                Synopsis: Brash adventurer Peter Quill finds himself the object of an unrelenting bounty 
                hunt after stealing a mysterious orb coveted by Ronan, a powerful villain with ambitions 
                that threaten the entire universe. To evade the ever-persistent Ronan, Quill is forced 
                into an uneasy truce with a quartet of disparate misfits-Rocket, a gun-toting raccoon, 
                Groot, a tree-like humanoid, the deadly and enigmatic Gamora and the revenge-driven Drax 
                the Destroyer. But when Quill discovers the true power of the orb and the menace it poses 
                to the cosmos, he must do his best to rally his ragtag rivals for a last, desperate 
                stand-with the galaxy's fate in the balance.

                Synopsis: John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd star as Jake and Elwood Blues, 
                two white boys with black soul. Sporting cool shades and look-alike suits, Jake

                Gibson, perform the theme from Rawhide before the most unruly bar crowd in written 
                history, and lay waste to hundreds of cars on the streets and freeways of Chicago.

                Synopsis: Fifteen-year-old Oliver Tate has two big ambitions: 
                to save his parents' marriage via carefully plotted intervention 
                and to lose his virginity before his next birthday. Worried 
                that his mom is having an affair with New Age weirdo Graham, 
                Oliver monitors his parents' sex life by charting the dimmer 
                switch in their bedroom. He also forges suggestive love letters 
                from his mom to dad. Meanwhile, Oliver attempts to woo his 
                classmate, Jordana, a self-professed pyromaniac who supervises 
                his journal writing - especially the bits about her. 
                When necessary, she orders him to cross things out. -- (C) Weinstein
